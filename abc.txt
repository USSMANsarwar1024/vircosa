
since we are just starting out, this feel more lie than truth, but i wanna share a story. from 2024 - onwards i had been a fragrant enthusiast and i like to buy and gift and use perfumes talk about them share insights with fellas and talking about more trending scents. we recently launched zephyr lux in our university - a mini brand or i should say a semester project and boom it went amazing our teacher liked the scents most, the students male female everyone, the co-ordinators loved the scents and we were given a special certifiation from our teacher no group was given that and it encouraged me and my fellows too much that instaead of staying a university project lets build a mini or local brand and i am devops and backend dev i can do tech stuff myself. so we are locally launching our perfume brand, first in lahore area then punjab, then nationally then internationally (Inshallah!).

so this is my story!

🟩Use PowerShell filtering (recommended)

Run this inside your project root:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory | 
Where-Object { $_.FullName -notmatch 'node_modules' } |
ForEach-Object { $_.FullName.Replace((Get-Location).Path + '\', '') }
✅ This prints a clean folder structure excluding node_modules/.

If you want to include files too:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | 
Where-Object { $_.FullName -notmatch 'node_modules' } |
ForEach-Object { $_.FullName.Replace((Get-Location).Path + '\', '') }


Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | 
Where-Object { $_.FullName -notmatch 'node_modules' } |
ForEach-Object { $_.FullName.Replace((Get-Location).Path + '\', '') }
